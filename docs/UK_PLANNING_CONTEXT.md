## Key Camden Policies

### Design Policies

**Policy D1 - Design**
> All development, including extensions and alterations, should be of the highest standard of design that respects local context and character.

Key requirements:
- Appropriate scale, height, and massing
- Quality materials and detailing
- Good relationship with neighbours
- Positive contribution to streetscape

**Policy D2 - Heritage**
> Development affecting heritage assets must preserve or enhance their significance and setting.

Applies to:
- Listed buildings (Grade I, II*, II)
- Conservation areas
- Locally listed buildings
- Archaeological priority areas

**Policy D3 - Residential Extensions**
> Extensions should be subordinate to the original building and respect its character.

Specific guidance:
- Rear extensions: typically single storey
- Side extensions: set back from front
- Dormers: sized appropriately, set back from eaves
- Basements: limited depth, impact on trees/gardens

### Amenity Policies

**Policy A1 - Managing the Impact of Development**
> Development should not cause unacceptable harm to neighbours' amenity.

Considerations:
- Daylight and sunlight (BRE guidelines)
- Outlook from habitable rooms
- Privacy and overlooking
- Noise and disturbance

### Conservation Area Considerations

**Section 72 of the Planning Act 1990**
> Special attention shall be paid to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character or appearance of a conservation area.

Additional requirements in conservation areas:
- Higher design standards
- Appropriate materials
- Preservation of historic features
- Consideration of cumulative impact

## Common Development Types

### Rear Extensions

**Generally Acceptable:**
- Single storey, up to 3m projection (terraced) or 4m (detached)
- Flat or glazed roof
- Does not exceed boundary wall height
- 45° rule for neighbour light

**Design Considerations:**
- Subordinate to main building
- Matching or complementary materials
- Impact on garden space
- Relationship with neighbours

### Loft Conversions/Dormers

**Generally Acceptable:**
- Rear dormers (conservation area caveats)
- Set back from eaves and verge
- Subordinate scale
- Matching materials

**Usually Refused:**
- Front dormers in conservation areas
- Box dormers on Victorian/Edwardian houses
- Exceeding ridge height
- Dominating roof slope

### Basements

**Camden's Basement SPD Requirements:**
- Maximum 1 storey (3m depth)
- Must not extend under entire garden
- Structural stability assessment required
- Construction Management Plan needed
- 12-month construction limit

**Restrictions:**
- Article 4 areas may prohibit
- Flood risk zones
- Tree preservation orders
- Impact on neighbours

## Precedent Value

### How Precedent Works

UK planning does not have a strict precedent system like case law, but consistency is required:

> "Similar cases should be treated similarly unless there are good planning reasons to distinguish them."

### When Precedent is Strong

1. Same street or immediate area
2. Similar property type
3. Recent decision (within 2-3 years)
4. No policy changes since
5. Same key considerations

### When Precedent is Weak

1. Different conservation area
2. Material difference in design/scale
3. Policy changes since decision
4. Site-specific circumstances differ
5. Cumulative development concerns

## Appeal Process

### Grounds for Appeal

1. **Refusal of permission** - Most common
2. **Non-determination** - No decision in time
3. **Conditions** - Unreasonable conditions imposed

### Appeal Methods

1. **Written representations** - Most householder appeals
2. **Informal hearing** - Officer presents case
3. **Public inquiry** - Major/complex cases

### Success Rates (Camden)

- Householder appeals: ~40% success
- Other appeals: ~30% success
- Better success with good precedent evidence

### Using Precedent in Appeals

Inspectors consider:
- Consistency of decision-making
- Material similarity of cases
- Current policy context
- Site-specific factors

**Winning approach:**
> "The Council approved application 2023/XXXX/P at nearby No.10 for an identical development. No material planning reason exists to justify a different outcome for this site."
